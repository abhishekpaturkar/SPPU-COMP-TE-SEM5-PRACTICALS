Welcome to the SPPU Third Year Computer Engineering Lab Assignments repository! This repository contains the source code and related materials for the lab assignments of the Computer Engineering branch at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU).

## Introduction:

In the third year of the Computer Engineering program at SPPU, students undertake various laboratory assignments to reinforce their knowledge of theoretical concepts and gain hands-on experience. This repository is created to centralize the lab assignment codes for Laboratory Practices - 1 (LP-1) which include SPOS and DS (Distributed Systems) and the Database Management System (DBMS) lab.

## Lab Assignments:

This repository is organized into folders for two specific labs:

1. [LP-1 Lab](LP-1): This folder contains the source code and materials for the Laboratory Practices - 1 (LP-1) lab assignments.

2. [DBMS Lab](DBMS-Queries): This folder contains the source code and relevant materials for the Database Management System (DBMS) lab assignments.

You can navigate to each assignment folder to access the source code and any relevant documentation.

If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to reach out to the repository maintainer. Happy coding!
